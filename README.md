## run_analysis.R
## ==============

## This is the script for Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
## I have finish the first four steps as below:

##        1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
##        2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
##        3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
##        4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 


## I'm afraid I didn't finish all the project(step 5 remains to be done) because it is a little difficult for me.
## And the time is limited, so I'll try my best to type as much as I can.
## If you find any bug or you have any new idea about my code, leave me a message or comment during the peer review process.

## Thank you very much
## Best,
## Alex
