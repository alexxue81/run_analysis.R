## ==============

## This is the script for Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
## I have finished all the steps as below:

##        1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
##        2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
##        3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
##        4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
##        5.Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 


## If you find any bug or you have any new idea about my code, leave me a message or comment during the peer review process.

## Thank you very much
## Best,
